def gradient_descent():
    # Approach problem by solving for the shortest distance between point P and
    # a point on the plane. Create an algorithm that minimizes the distance
    # between the points P and G (G must be a point in the plane).
    # Goal: Find the (x, y, z) coordinates that correspond to the minimum of
    # the cost function

    # Equation: b = a - gamma*gradient
    # b is next point, a is current point, gamma is step size, gradient is
    # the gradient of the cost function

    # Begin with an initial point guess

    # Calculate distance between a point on plane and point P
    # This will be the cost function
